# Analysis of Complex Network

# Dataset
- USAir97 (https://networkrepository.com/USAir97.php) is an undirected weighted network formed by the direct air route between the American airports in 1997. Each node stands for an airport and each edge represents an airline between two airports. It is a weighted network and link weights represent the relative number of the flights US Air had in 1997.
- Euroroad (https://networkrepository.com/road-euroroad.php) is an undirected network describing the international E-road network, updated to the year 2015. The international E-road network is a numbering system for roads in Europe developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). The network is numbered from E1 up and its roads cross national borders. It also reaches Central Asian countries like Kyrgyzstan, since they are members of the UNECE. Main international traffic arteries in Europe are defined by ECE/TRANS/SC.1/2016/3/Rev.1 in which three types of roads are considered: motorways, limited access roads, and ordinary roads.
